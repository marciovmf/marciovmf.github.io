        <h2>Cryengine</h2>
        <iframe width="560" height="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vUyWwqY-pYc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Cryengine is a game engine designed by the German game developer <a href="https://www.crytek.com/">Crytek</a>. It has been used in all of their titles with the initial version being used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry">Far Cry</a>, and continues to be updated to support new consoles and hardware for their games. It has also been used for many third-party games under Crytek's licensing scheme.</p>
        <p> CryEngine is the project I'm currently working on full time as a build engineer along with the development of the engine's core systems.</p>
				<p>Most of the time I'm writing CMake rules, fixing C++ code on the engine's core systems, tweaking compiler
				flags or writing tech to improve and simplify how games are built with CryEngine. Besides working on building
				the (many flavors of the) engine itself, I'm constantly working and improving the engine's ability to build and
				run games straight from the editor or to be flexible enough to adapt to whatever the game teams might need for a
				specific title.</p>

        <h2>Looney Tunes World of Mayhem</h2>
        <iframe width="560" height="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pe41WmIkUV8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4>Developed by <a haref="https://www.aquiris.com.br/">Aquiris</a> and published by <a href=""https://scopely.com/>Scopely</a>.</h4>
        <p>Looney Tunes: World of Mayhem is an action RPG that lets players collect teams of characters from classic cartoons. Each character has its own strengths and weaknesses, along with some hilarious fighting abilities. For example, Bugs Bunny has a safe dropping skill, while Marvin the Martian has a raygun to shoot enemies with. The idea is to build a team of these classic characters, which are earned through gameplay, to take on other teams of cartoons to win items that help with leveling up and tuning up skills. Each "level" has a series of battles to complete, but players can also go up against other players in PvP to steal crates of goodies from them.</p>
        <p>I got involved with tis tittle since the first year of development and working on it for about 4 years and eventually I became one of the lead developers at some point.

        <h2>Personal Game engine development</h2>
        <iframe width="560" height="560" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fy2DIYjDo-A" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p> On the very little free time I have, I like making videos about game/engine development on my youtube channel.</p>

        <p>At the moment, there is an ongoing series where I am developing a game engine
        from scratch without any third party libraries. The goal of the series is to
        teach beginners about game programing in Portuguese, since most of the material
        online is in english. The full series playlist can be found <a
                                                                      href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt_f2ildHl1lZdx8R3CjjH50R8EV6d7CH">here</a>.</p>
